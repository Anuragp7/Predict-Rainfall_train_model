Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning üåßÔ∏è
This project focuses on predicting rainfall using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical weather data, the model aims to forecast whether it will rain, helping in agricultural planning, disaster management, and daily decision-making.

Key Features:
Dataset: Utilizes weather data containing features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.
Preprocessing: Handles missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
Modeling: Implements classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Evaluation: Compares models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
Visualization: Provides insights through graphs and plots for better understanding of the data and predictions.
Tools & Technologies:
Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and analysis
